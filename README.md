### Launch your development career with project-based coaching on [JS Mastery Pro](https://www.jsmastery.pro).
###10-step guide on how to proceed with tailoring your web app idea for Gnosis / Stamp system to make it a Swarm native app:

Convert your existing client code to work with the Swarm network. You can do this by changing the URLs of any external resources (such as images or scripts) to Swarm hashes.

Set up a Swarm node or use a public gateway to host your app's files. You can use the official Swarm gateway or one of the many public gateways available.

Use the Swarm command-line tools to upload your app's files to the Swarm network. You can use the swarm up command to upload individual files or the swarm recursive command to upload entire directories.

Create a Gnosis Safe multisig wallet for your app's funds. You can do this using the Gnosis Safe web app or the Gnosis Safe CLI.

Fund your Gnosis Safe wallet with the necessary funds for your app's crowdfunding campaign. You can do this by sending ETH or any ERC-20 token to the Gnosis Safe wallet's address.

Create a new instance of the SimpleGnosisCrowdfunding contract on the Gnosis chain. You can do this using Remix or any other Solidity compiler.

Deploy the SimpleGnosisCrowdfunding contract to the Gnosis chain using your Gnosis Safe wallet. You can do this using the Gnosis Safe web app or the Gnosis Safe CLI.

Once your contract is deployed, copy its address and include it in your Swarm app code. This will allow your app to interact with the contract and accept crowdfunding contributions.

Test your app to make sure it works correctly on the Swarm network and with the Gnosis / Stamp system. You can do this by using a local Swarm node or by using one of the public gateways.

Once your app is working correctly, launch your crowdfunding campaign and start promoting your app to potential supporters!

I hope this helps you in tailoring your web app idea for Gnosis / Stamp system to make it a Swarm native app. Good luck with your project!
